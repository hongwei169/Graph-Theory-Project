# Graph-Theory-Project

This is a project on the Graph Isomorphism Problem, which is a well-known problem in graph theory. The objective of this project is to implement algorithms to determine if two given graphs are isomorphic or not, using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Content
- Introduction of Graph Isomorphism Problem
- Conditions for Isomorphsim
- Example code for checking isomorphism
-  Babai's algorithm

## Usage
The graph_isomorphism.ipynb notebook contains the code to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic or not:
To run the algorithms, simply execute the cells in the notebook.
