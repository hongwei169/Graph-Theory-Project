    "The graph isomorphism problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, mathematics, and other related fields. This problem is concerned with determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic or not.  In other words, if we can rearrange the vertices and edges of one graph to obtain the other graph, then they are isomorphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, the graph isomorphism problem arises in many different contexts. For example, it is important in the design and analysis of algorithms that operate on graphs, such as network routing algorithms or social network analysis algorithms. It is also relevant in the study of database systems, where graphs can be used to represent relationships between data objects, and in machine learning, where graphs can be used to represent data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the graph isomorphism problem is an important and challenging problem in computer science and mathematics, with numerous applications in various fields. Despite its difficulty, researchers continue to study this problem and develop new methods and algorithms to solve it, as it has the potential to unlock insights and solutions in many different areas of science and technology.\n",

    "# Babai's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Babai's algorithm is a computational procedure that was developed by Laszlo Babai in 2015, a Hungarian mathematician and computer scientist. This algorithm is used to solve the Graph Isomorphism problem which is a fundamental problem in the field of computer science. The Graph Isomorphism problem is concerned with determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic. An isomorphic graph is one that has the same structure as another graph, but with different labels assigned to its vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Babai's algorithm is considered to be a significant breakthrough in the field of computational complexity theory. It has been shown to be capable of solving the Graph Isomorphism problem in quasipolynomial time. This is a significant improvement over previous algorithms, which were only able to solve the problem in exponential time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by first transforming the two graphs into their canonical form. This means that the algorithm is able to find a unique representation of each graph that is independent of any particular labeling of the vertices. Once the graphs have been transformed into their canonical form, the algorithm compares them to determine whether they are isomorphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of Babai's algorithm has significant implications for a wide range of fields, including cryptography, computer science, and mathematics. It has the potential to be used in the development of more efficient algorithms for solving other complex problems. Additionally, it has opened up new avenues of research in the field of computational complexity theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Babai's algorithm is a powerful computational tool that has revolutionized the way that we approach the Graph Isomorphism problem. Its ability to solve the problem in quasipolynomial time has significant implications for a wide range of fields, and it has the potential to be used in the development of more efficient algorithms for solving other complex problems.
